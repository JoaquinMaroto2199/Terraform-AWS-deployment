Terraform AWS is a personal project in which I have been working towards developing a full IaC for AWS. 
It includes all the configurations, provisioners, modules, workspaces and many other components of Terraform which I have been adding throughout my learning path.
Any use of configurations/resources used are public and therefore, can be used by any other individual/company worlwide.
